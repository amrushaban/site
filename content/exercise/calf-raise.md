The individual starts with both feet on the edge of a raised surface, with the toes on the surface and the heels lower than the toes. The heels are raised as high as possible, then returned to the starting position.

The difficulty may be increased by performing the exercise on one leg.

The Cliffhanger variant requires one foot only to be placed on the surface and the position held as long as possible in isometric tension.

The Donkey Calf Raises variant requires that the individual bend at the waist to about 90 degrees and rest the arms on a chair or other stable surface.

The Little Piggies variant is performed by placing the heels on the surface, and moves the toes instead.
