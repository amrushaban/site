The bodyweight Pull Up is another common indicator of an individual's general fitness level and is also included as one of the "big three" bodyweight exercises in the Navy Seal BUD/S Physical Screening Test.

The individual starts by hanging from a bar with the arms extended and the palms facing away from the exerciser. The body is then pulled up using the arms until the elbows are bent and the head is higher than the hands. If the hands are moved closer, more emphasis is placed on the biceps and elbow flexors.
