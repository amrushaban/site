The individual begins in a push up position and performs a single push up. Then the individual will kneel and raise their hands in the air four times as if they are performing an unweighted overhead press. The individual then performs two push ups, then kneels and performs eight unweighted overhead presses. The individual will continue to ladder up in this manner, with the count of unweighted overhead presses equalling four times the number of pushups. When muscle failure is reached, the individual then ladders down with a decreasing number of push ups and a corresponding number of unweighted overhead presses.

The bodyweight Push Up is a common marker of an individual's general fitness level; for this reason it is included as one of the "big three" bodyweight exercises in the Navy Seal BUD/S Physical Screening Test. The bodyweight push-up has many distinct variations, many of which are listed below.
